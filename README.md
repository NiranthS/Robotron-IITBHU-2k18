-the solution of the second runner up in the introductory event of Robotics Club, IIT(BHU) Varanasi.
 
 **Problem Statement**:
                  The goal was to make a robot that can operate in manual and autonomous mode to complete the following tasks.

1) **Manual mode**:
              The operator maneuvers the robot to move three keys distributed in the arena towards the respected  RFID tags, which inturn switches off the laser security system and thereby clears the path for the robot to progress.

2) **Autonomous mode**:
                Once all the lasers are switched off, the robot gets into autonomous mode where it follows a white line on a black surface which is the predefined path towards the destination.
